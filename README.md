## Features

- **Easy Integration**: Connect your React app with MetaMask effortlessly.
- **Wallet Management**: Facilitate wallet interactions, including sending and receiving Ethereum.
- **Transaction Handling**: Simplify the process of creating and sending transactions.
- **User-Friendly**: Designed with simplicity in mind for both developers and users.
- **Support for Multiple Networks**: Connect to various Ethereum networks.

## Installation

To install the MetaMask Wallet API, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Daviid9503/Metamask-Wallet-Api-React-Web3-Extension-Connect-Blockhain-Ethereum.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Metamask-Wallet-Api-React-Web3-Extension-Connect-Blockhain-Ethereum
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

After installation, you can start using the MetaMask Wallet API in your React application. Below is a simple example of how to connect to MetaMask and display the user's Ethereum address.

### Example Code

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import Web3 from 'web3';

const App = () => {
    const [account, setAccount] = useState('');

    useEffect(() => {
        const loadBlockchainData = async () => {
            if (window.ethereum) {
                const web3 = new Web3(window.ethereum);
                await window.ethereum.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' });
                const accounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts();
                setAccount(accounts[0]);
            } else {
                alert('Please install MetaMask!');
            }
        };

        loadBlockchainData();
    }, []);

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Welcome to MetaMask Wallet Integration</h1>
            <p>Your Ethereum account: {account}</p>
        </div>
    );
};

export default App;
```

This code initializes Web3 and requests access to the user's MetaMask account. It then displays the user's Ethereum address.
